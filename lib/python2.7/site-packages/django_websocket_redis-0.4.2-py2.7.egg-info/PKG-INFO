        Websockets for Django using Redis as message queue
        --------------------------------------------------
        This module implements websockets on top of Django without requiring any additional framework. For
        messaging it uses the [Redis](http://redis.io/) datastore and in a production environment, it is
        intended to work under [uWSGI](http://projects.unbit.it/uwsgi/) and behind [NGiNX](http://nginx.com/).
        
        New in 0.4.2
        ------------
        * Message echoing can be switched “on” and “off” according to the user needs. Before it was “on” by
          default.
        * Many changes to become compatible with Python3; there are still minor issues to solve.
        * The message string to be passed and stored to and from the websocket hase been converted into
          a class ``RedisMessage`` for type saftey.
        
        Features
        --------
        * Largely scalable for Django applications with hundreds of open websocket connections.
        * Runs in a cooperative concurrency model using [gevent](http://www.gevent.org/), thus only one
          thread/process is simultaneously required to control **all** open websockets.
        * Full control over the main loop during development, so **Django** can be started as usual with
          ``./manage.py runserver``.
        * No dependency to any other asynchronous event driven framework, such as Tornado, Twisted or
          Node.js.
        * Optionally persiting messages, allowing server reboots and client reconnections.
        * The only additional requirement is a running instance of **Redis**, which by the way is a good
          replacement for memcached.
        
        If unsure, if this proposed architecture is the correct approach on how to integrate websockets with Django, then please read Roberto De Ioris article about [Offloading Websockets and Server-Sent Events AKA “Combine them with Django safely”](http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/articles/OffloadingWebsocketsAndSSE.html).
